First install all the requirement using the following command `pip install -r requirement.txt`

Model is trained from `train.csv` and tested using `test.csv` . 

Model training is done model `Model_training.ipynb` with all required evaluation metrices and models are stored. 

`Holdout.csv` is passed to the trained model using `Model_Use.ipynb` and the solution is stored in `submission.csv`
